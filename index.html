        <p>The middle-man app for IMDB that you never asked for, and don't really need! Search for your favorite movie, or enter a keyword and click a movie poster below to be taken straight to the IMBD page for that movie. Or you can just visit IMBD and search there. But if you love extra steps, this app is for you! Go ahead, try it. Or don't, that's okay too.</p>
