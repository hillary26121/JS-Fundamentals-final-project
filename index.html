        The middle-man app for IMDB that you never asked for, and don't really
        need! Search for your favorite movie, or enter a keyword and click a
        movie poster below to be taken straight to the IMBD page for that movie.
        Or you can click the button below, and get a movie now playing in
        theatres. Or you can just visit IMBD and search there. But if you love
        extra steps, this app is for you! Go ahead, try it. Or don't, that's
        okay too.
